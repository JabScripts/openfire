Hello, thanks for downloading the file!
If you don't really know what will "openfire" work for keep reading this!
I create "openfire" command because I want to get better roleplay, so when robers want to start shooting, they need to type "/op".
And until the police won't do "/opok" (that mean they accept the openfire), they must not shot, or this will be violation rule "RDM".
And if will people abuse the command, I already made a plan about update that, in console you will see who type the "/op" and who "/opok".
Probably I will create webhook for discord, to get discord notification when someone will use the command.
If normal play will want to type "/opok", on his display will appear "[Error]: You don't have permission to do this!".



So if you want to give permmision to police officers you need to follow the next steps!


1: You need to drag the "perms.cfg", there, where you have your server.cfg, resource, cache, etc.

2: You will need to go into "server.cfg", and add "exec perms.cfg" somewhere in the top

3: Open the "perms.cfg" and you will see what you need to do, to add perms for police.



That's all, thank you, if you have any questions about the script, you can join my discord and ask me!
